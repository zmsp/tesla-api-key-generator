Work in progress. Currently having issues with reaching Tesla API from the browser as modern browser blocks CORS request. 

the page shoud be available on zmsp.github.io/tesla-token/index


# Motivation: 
Eventhough tesla's unofficial API supports it, Tesla doesn't yet have a way of generating api key AKA bearer token. This tool aims to allow generation and expiration of Tesla api token from the browser.
